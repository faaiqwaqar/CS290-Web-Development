		<h3>
		What challenges or troubles did you have completing this
		assignment? How did you solve them?
		</h3>
		<p>
		For me, the most challenging part of this assignment was understanding
		the requirements and formatting for my program. After having taken the
		CS 160 series, and programming in C, I have had a pretty good idea of
		what was expected of me in a programming assignment. When working with
		put html, I didnt know what was appropriate spacing, or commenting
		or what was even expected in titles. I asked my peers and the instructor
		to overcome this, and hope I will understand it better in the future.
		</p>

		<h3>
		What did you learn from this assignment? What did you
		already know?
		</h3>
		<p>
		I learned a basis of HTML text styles, and how to effectively use
		them to produce a basic looking page that can be set unto a server,
		which is more than what I knew to do before this initial assignment
		and handful of lectures.
		</p>

		<h3>
		What resources were most helpful in completing this
		assignment? How did you use these resources?
		</h3>
		<p>
		The most helpful resource for myself in this assignment was
		looking at piazza questions, and the guidance in the first set of
		lecture notes posted by the instructor. Piazza helped me understand
		issues I might have had and others were having and helped me not
		make those mistakes. The note packet helped me learn the basics of
		HTML that I used in this program.
